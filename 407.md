## COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT

*Lyla: Okay, here’s a hypothetical. You ask a girl for her number, but wait two weeks to call her. What gives?*

*George: Well, that depends. Why?*

*Lyla: Well, I met this guy two weeks ago at a party. We spent the entire evening talking and I thought we really hit it off. We had a lot of chemistry and we had a ton of things in common. He asked for my number and he said he’d call me the next day. And then, I didn’t hear hide nor hair of him until yesterday, 10 days after we met. How come?*

*George: What did he say when he called? What was his pathetic excuse?*

*Lyla: I didn’t talk to him. I wasn’t home and he left a voicemail message. I haven’t called him back yet.*

*George: Why don’t you just call him and find out?*

*Lyla: He just called yesterday and I don’t want to seem desperate.*

*George: Oh, come on. He probably just lost your number and found it yesterday.*
